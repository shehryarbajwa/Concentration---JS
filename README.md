## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## GamePlay

The game has a total of 16 moves and 8 paired matches. There is a timer that begins once the first card is clicked. After, the first card is clicked, the timer begins. Once the timer starts, it stops once the gamePlay is finished and a modal appears congratulating the player. The score is calculated by how many moves it takes to finish all 8 pairs of cards. Once the modal appears, the player can choose between cancelling or choosing to replay the game. The reset button shuffles the cards again and allows you restart the game.
